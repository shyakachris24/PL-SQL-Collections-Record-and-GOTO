# PL/SQL Practicum Project – Library Management System

## Project Overview
This PL/SQL project simulates how a basic library management system helps track book loans and calculate late fees. It's designed to demonstrate three key PL/SQL programming concepts in a real-world context.

The project demonstrates three key PL/SQL concepts:

- **Collections (Nested Table)** – to store multiple claims  
- **Records (User-defined composite type)** – to group claim details  
- **GOTO statements (Control flow handling)** – to skip or handle special cases

## ✨ Features
-Track book checkout status

-Calculate overdue fees

-Generate simple reports

-Handle errors gracefully

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
1. # create the tables

This image shows the relationship between two tables created that are going to be used in my project.
## 🧩 Features Demonstrated
### ✔ Collections
 Book carts that hold multiple book cards for batch processing
 ### ✔ Records
 Book information cards that hold all details together (ID, title, due date, fees)
 ### ✔ GOTO Statements
  Library shortcuts that jump directly to error handling when books are missing
